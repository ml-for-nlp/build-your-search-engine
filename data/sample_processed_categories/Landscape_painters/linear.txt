<doc id="10788353" title="Volcano School">
The Volcano School refers to a group of non-native Hawaiian artists who painted dramatic nocturnal scenes of Hawaii's erupting volcanoes.  Some of the artists also produced watercolors, which, by the nature of the medium, tended to be diurnal.  At their best, these paintings exemplify a fusion of the European Sublime aesthetic, Romantic landscapes, and the American landscape traditions.  Two volcanoes on the Island of Hawaii, Kilauea and Mauna Loa, were intermittently active during the 1880s and 1890s, when interest in Volcano School paintings peaked. Getting to Kilauea, the more frequently painted volcano required an arduous two- or three-day roundtrip journey on horseback.  
Printmaker and art educator Huc-Mazelet Luquiens called this period "a little Hawaiian renaissance".

James Pringle Cook (born 1947) is an American painter based in Tucson, Arizona, known nationally for expressive, monumental landscapes and urban scenes that employ vigorous brushwork and thick, impasto surfaces and move between realism and passages of abstraction. He has explored a wide range of geographies across the United States and subjects from craggy mountains and seascapes to industrial accidents to the figure. Curators and critics, however, generally agree that his work is as much about pure painting as it is about his convincing recapitulations of the world and a sense of place. Museum Director Robert Yassin described Cook as "a painter who is in love with painting [whose] bravura use of paint is akin to the abstract expressionists; unlike them, however, he provides viewers with a recognizable reality, ordered by his own personal vision and controlled by his technical mastery." Discussing his urban works, Margaret Regan wrote, "Cook is so skilled a painter he can turn almost anything into a thing of beauty […] His bravura handling of the paint is what matters: his pure layers of color, slabbed in thick gobs onto his linen canvases with a palette knife, glistening like butter."Cook has exhibited throughout the United States and in Canada in more than seventy solo exhibitions, including shows at the Tucson Museum of Art, Albrecht-Kemper Museum of Art and Roswell Museum and Art Center, and group exhibits at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and Wichita Art Museum, among many. His work has been featured in Arts Magazine, American Artist and New American Paintings (vol. 12, 24, 36), major newspapers including the Chicago Tribune, Arizona Daily Star, Philadelphia Inquirer and The New Mexican, and television news features in Dallas, Phoenix and Tucson. More than seventy museum and public collections hold Cook's work, including the Denver Art Museum, Phoenix Art Museum, and Milwaukee Art Museum.

Charles Henry Buckius Demuth (November 8, 1883 – October 23, 1935) was an American painter who specialized in watercolors and turned to oils late in his career, developing a style of painting known as Precisionism.
"Search the history of American art," wrote Ken Johnson in The New York Times, "and you will discover few watercolors more beautiful than those of Charles Demuth. Combining exacting botanical observation and loosely Cubist abstraction, his watercolors of flowers, fruit and vegetables have a magical liveliness and an almost shocking sensuousness."Demuth was a lifelong resident of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The home he shared with his mother is now the Demuth Museum, which showcases his work. He graduated from Franklin & Marshall Academy before studying at Drexel University and at Philadelphia's Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. While he was a student at PAFA, he participated in a show at the Academy, and also met William Carlos Williams at his boarding house. The two were fast friends and remained close for the rest of their lives.
He later studied at Académie Colarossi and Académie Julian in Paris, where he became a part of the avant garde art scene. The Parisian artistic community was accepting of Demuth's homosexuality. After his return to America, Demuth retained aspects of Cubism in many of his works.

<doc id="4331767" title="Mstislav Dobuzhinsky">
Mstislav Valerianovich Dobuzhinsky or Dobujinsky (Lithuanian: Mstislavas Dobužinskis, August 14, 1875, Novgorod – November 20, 1957, New York City) was a Lithuanian artist noted for his cityscapes conveying the explosive growth and decay of the early twentieth-century city.
Of noble Lithuanian extraction, Dobuzhinsky was born on August 14, 1875 in Novgorod into the family of an army officer. From 1885 to 1887, he attended the Drawing School of the Society for the Promotion of the Artists. Between 1895 and 1899, he read Law at the University of St. Petersburg, simultaneously studying in private studios. After graduating from the University, he was trained from 1899 to 1901 by Anton Ažbe in Munich and Simon Hollósy in Nagybánya (Austria-Hungary). In Munich, he came to be influenced by the Jugendstil. On his return to Russia, he joined the Mir Iskusstva, an artistic circle which idealized the 18th century as the "age of elegance".
Dobuzhinsky was distinguished from other miriskusniki by his expressionist manner and keen interest in modern industrial cityscapes. He often painted seedy or tragic scenes from urban life which expressed the nightmarish bleakness and loneliness of modern times. Among his works were also humorous vignettes and sketches with demon-like creatures which seemed to embody the monstrosities of urbanization.
Like other members of the Mir iskusstva, Dobuzhinsky also experimented with scenic design. At first he worked for Constantin Stanislavski at the Moscow Arts Theatre, but later on also contributed sets to several Diaghilev productions. He was renowned as an excellent art teacher; among his young pupils was Vladimir Nabokov, with whom he maintained correspondence for decades.

During the First World War Dobuzhinsky went with Eugene Lanceray to the front lines to sketch.  In 1918, he supervised the theatrical workshop at the State Educational Workshops of the Decorative Arts (the former Stieglitz School of the Technical Drawing). In 1920, he took part in the Second Congress of the Communist International. In 1923-24, he went abroad to study developments in European art and to arrange one-man shows. In 1924, Dobuzhinsky followed the advice of Jurgis Baltrusaitis and withdrew to Lithuania. He was naturalized there in 1924 and lived in Kaunas until 1925. Between 1925 and 1929 lived in Paris where he designed sets for Nikita Balieff's The Bat. He returned to Lithuania in 1929. In Lithuania he worked at a state theatre as scenographer and created scenography for 38 plays, besides running a private painting school (1930–1933).He then emigrated to England in 1935, and moved to the United States in 1939 where he stayed for the duration of the war. He spent the last ten years of his life in Europe, occasionally returning to New York for theatrical work. He died in New York on November 20, 1957. His memoirs were published posthumously in Russian.
Among his later works are series of masterful and dramatic illustrations, notably for Dostoyevsky's White Nights (1923) and Yuri Olesha's Three Fat Men (1925). Dobuzhinsky contributed sets for theatre productions in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, and Düsseldorf. During World War II, Dobuzhinsky painted imaginary landscapes of the besieged Leningrad.
He is interred at the Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery Departement de l'Essonne, Ile-de-France, France; Plot: grave 3428.

<doc id="59897016" title="Tom Goldenberg">
Tom Goldenberg (born 1948) is an American artist, best known for landscape and abstract paintings. He has shown throughout the United States and internationally, and his work has been covered by The New York Times, The New Criterion, Art in America, Arts Magazine, Art & Antiques, and The New York Observer, among other publications. Critics often note his landscape works for their contemporary interplay of stylization and observation and concern for form over verisimilitude, pointing to his beginnings in abstraction as a foundation that underlies his ordered pictorial structures. In the later 2010s, Goldenberg has returned to abstraction that sometimes suggests interior or "fictive" landscapes. The New Criterion editor and writer Roger Kimball described his paintings as leading "double lives, as memorable evocations of rural landscape and tightly organized arrangements of abstract planes of color." Hilton Kramer characterized his work as "deeply mediated by aesthetic reflection" and classical rather than romantic in feeling. Goldenberg and his wife, Michelle Alfandari, have lived in Sharon, Connecticut since 2016, after being based in New York City since the 1970s.

<doc id="45257890" title="Mosh Kashi">
Mosh Kashi (born in 1966 in Jerusalem) is an Israeli painter and artist. Senior Lecturer at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem. In his works, Kashi raises issues that deals with painting in the contemporary era. Kashi's art has been exhibited in Israel and worldwide. He won the Young Artist Award (1994), Artistic Achievement Award (1997) and Ministry of Education (Israel) Culture and Sport Prize (2004).Kashi is a contemporary pantheist that his painting study field is based on views and imagery from nature. His paintings include fields, trees and entanglement, landscape and wide open space that try to express a place of which time stops, which is timeless and space less. Kashi's paintings are not created as a single painting but are created as a series of paintings. Every painting stands by itself and in every series there's a slow and research like attendance of the chosen subject. This kind of method of work allows Kashi to investigate, analyze and accuracy.
"Kashi's works demand active, prolonged observation to gradually decipher the painter's interpretation of the subject. the works dictate the time they require. Each work invites the viewer to set an inner clock while observing it. The slow viewing process also contains an element of surprise. Kashi's works invoke contemplations; they raise doubts and quandaries, without providing answers. They strive to sharpen attention, to indicate the possibilities of the gaze, to unravel thought without stitching it together again. Making innovative, fascinating use of traditional painting techniques, Kashi does not give up the act of painting, but his work draws on insights that derive from the experience and thinking of modern and contemporary art. The poetic and metaphorical value carried by the painting alludes, on the one hand, to Mark Rothko's color fields, and on the other—to Gerhard Richter's work. The painting is thus charged with layers of time and place beyond the here-and-now".
Ruthi ofek "Infinite Painterly Landscapes" "Kashi's paintings carry within them the anxiety of an encounter with the "sensitive viewer" signaled in the mid-20th century by Mark Rothko, the viewer whose gaze and insights seal a painting's fate: if the experience does not enchant him, if the dark shimmering tones fail to claim his attention, he may be astounded by the painting's technical virtuosity but will not emotionally enter Kashi's core preoccupation with landscape spaces that hedge in a dense, velvety darkness. As in the paintings of the German painter Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840), which contemplate the mystery of the universe through moonlight and the mist of a wide sea, Kashi too, albeit neither wearing the monk's robe, nor invigorated by religious belief, gazes directly at the enigma of light and dark, growth and withering.Bygone centuries have not weakened the experience but honed its reception."
