<doc id="46610907" title="The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (musical)">
The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz is a musical written by David Spencer and Disney composer Alan Menken (eight-time Oscar-winning composer). The play is based on Canadian author Mordecai Richler's 1959 novel of the same name. The musical is a "morality tale" set in 1950s' Montreal, Canada, about 19-year-old Duddy Kravitz, from the Jewish working-class inner city, who is desperate to make his mark and prove himself to his family and community. After his grandfather tells him that "a man without land is nobody," he works and schemes to buy and develop a lakefront property, but his ambition threatens his personal relationships with those who love him, among them a French Canadian girl he meets while working at a summer resort. Duddy often behaves as a  "nervy young hustler" but is at the same time fiercely loyal to those whom he loves. He must "ultimately decide what kind of man he's going to be." The story ended on a bleak note with Duddy isolated and morally compromised, having accomplished his goals only by betraying close friends, including his epileptic and paraplegic friend Virgil, and becoming estranged from his grandfather.
An early form of the musical called Duddy was scored by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller in 1984 and premiered at Edmonton's Citadel Theater in April 1984, with Lonny Price as Duddy. The unconventional combination of the story's dark tones with a musical style confused audiences, who were further antagonized by Mordecai Richler's dismissive opinion of Edmonton in newspapers. Although the show intended a cross-country run through Canada, poor ticket sales and savage press reviews resulted in the play fizzling by the time it reached Ottawa's National Arts Centre, whereupon it was cancelled before performing in Toronto or even its Montreal setting, losing backers an estimated $500,000.A second adaptation followed with Spencer serving only as lyricist, with direction by Austin Pendleton. The play opened in October 1987 in Philadelphia. Ultimately it was again a troubled production as cast and backers feuded over revising the dark ending to please audiences; the play failed to reach New York theaters.

After the second staging's failure the play's writers decided to re-investigate the material and soften the ending, although Richler died in 2001 never having seen the final changes. Spencer took over as librettist, starting his adaptation from scratch (he would refer to it as "an altogether different musical with the exact same title"). Approximately 3/4 of the original score was dropped, most of the rest was revised in favor of the new structure, and the piece went through constant refinement as it was worked on over some twenty years. In June 2015 after refusals from several theaters the new version had its premiere in Montreal at the Segal Center for Performing Arts. This production was directed again by Pendleton and featured a cast headed by Ken James Stewart (Duddy), George Masswohl (Max Kravitz), Marie-Pierre de Brienne (Yvette Durelle), and including Howard Jerome, Adrian Marchuk, Victor A. Young, David Coomber, Sam Rosenthal, Michael Rudder, Kristian Truelsen, Albane Chateau, Gab Desmond, Julia Halfyard, Michael Esposito II, and Michael Daniel Murphy. The sold-out engagement received mostly positive-to-rave reviews and was twice extended, and an original cast album was released in December 2016 on the Ghostlight label.

<doc id="309134" title="Aspects of Love">
Aspects of Love is a musical with a book and music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Don Black and Charles Hart. It is famous for the song "Love Changes Everything."
Based on the novella of the same name by David Garnett, the piece focuses on the romantic entanglements of actress Rose Vibert, her admiring fan Alex Dillingham, his underage cousin Jenny, his uncle George, and George's mistress, sculptor Giulietta Trapani, over a period of 17 years. The "aspects" of the title refers to the many forms that love takes in the show: love between couples, both as romantic infatuation and as married people; children and their parents; and hints of same-sex attraction (Giulietta and Rose).
Lloyd Webber was introduced to Aspects of Love in 1979, when he and Tim Rice were approached to write a few songs for a proposed film version. When nothing came of it, he suggested to Trevor Nunn that they collaborate on a stage adaptation. In 1983, they presented a cabaret of numbers they had written, but it was not until five years later that they tackled the project in earnest. For the finished project, Lloyd Webber used at least five of the tunes he had written for the 1986 one-act musical Cricket, which he had written with Tim Rice.

<doc id="2015315" title="Beauty and the Beast (musical)">
Beauty and the Beast is a musical with music by Alan Menken, lyrics by Howard Ashman and Tim Rice, and book by Linda Woolverton. Adapted from Walt Disney Pictures' Academy Award-winning 1991 animated musical film of the same name – which in turn had been based on the classic French fairy tale by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont – Beauty and the Beast tells the story of a cold-blooded prince who has been magically transformed into an unsightly creature as punishment for his selfish ways. To revert into his true human form, the Beast must first learn to love a bright, beautiful young woman whom he has imprisoned in his enchanted castle before it is too late.
Critics, who hailed the film as one of the year's finest musicals, immediately noted its Broadway musical potential when it was first released in 1991, encouraging Disney CEO Michael Eisner to venture into Broadway. All eight songs from the animated film were reused in the musical, including a resurrected musical number which had been cut from the motion picture. Original songwriter Menken composed six new songs for the production alongside lyricist Rice, replacing Ashman who had died during production of the film. Woolverton, who had written the film's screenplay, adapted her own work into the musical's libretto, and specifically expanded upon the characterization of the Beast. Woolverton also expanded the storylines of the castle staff from servants who had already been transformed into household objects into humans who were gradually turning into inanimate objects. Costumes were designed by Ann Hould-Ward, who based her creations on both the animators' original designs as well as the Rococo art movement after researching how clothing and household objects looked during the 18th century.
After completing tryouts in Houston, Beauty and the Beast premiered on Broadway on April 18, 1994, starring Susan Egan and Terrence Mann as the eponymous Belle and Beast, respectively. The musical opened to mixed reviews from theatre critics, but was a massive commercial success and well received by audiences. Beauty ran on Broadway for 5,461 performances for thirteen years (1994 - 2007), becoming Broadway's tenth longest-running production in history. The musical has grossed more than $1.7 billon worldwide and played in thirteen countries and 115 cities. It has also become a popular choice for junior, amateur and high school productions.

Caddie Woodlawn a Musical Drama is a musical based on the novel Caddie Woodlawn by Carol Ryrie Brink. The book, music and lyrics are by Tom Shelton and Susan C. Hunter.
In 1935 Carol Ryrie Brink wrote the Newbery Medal —winning novel,Caddie Woodlawn, based on the childhood of her grandmother, Caroline Woodhouse. She had collected the stories that her grandmother had often recounted of her adventures as a pioneer child settling the wilderness of western Wisconsin in the mid-1800s. It won the Newbery Medal in 1936.In the musical, as in the original novel, Caddie, a high-spirited Wisconsin pioneer girl beloved by generations of readers, leads her willing siblings in a series of adventures, not always with the approval of her traditional Bostonian mother. Her father, however, encourages her antics, that she might thrive in the new, tougher ways of the west. In a  climax, Caddie single-handedly diffuses a potentially deadly clash between the terrified settlers and the local Dakota tribe through a daring and dangerous act. But her action only deepens her conflict with her mother. Ultimately, Caddie learns invaluable lessons about reconciling the head-strong child she's been, and the responsible adult she is soon to be. Through it all, the sacredness of tradition—passed from one generation to the next—is powerfully dramatized. As one wise friend tells Caddie: "families -- they're our link to forever, lass." [1]

Everything about La Cava is huge: big themes, grand passions, epic story, towering set, soaring score. It is like being swallowed up by a historical romance." [1] In CurtainUp London, Lizzie Loveridge wrote, "It is an effervescent mix of stars with sex appeal, original choreography, sweet music, tongue in cheek lyrics, and high drama."[2]  David Benedict of The Times observed, "Laurence O'Keefe and Stephen Keeling's score has size, energy, and even a bit of soul."[3]  The Daily Telegraph review began, "Another day, another doomed musical. Yet of all the turkeys that have arrived on our stages recently, La Cava is the one I've enjoyed most."[4] The review went on to say "Although the bovine stupidity of producers continue to baffle me.  The backers of this show would have had a better chance of getting their money back if they had chucked it into the Thames."

<doc id="1303197" title="Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)">
Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella is a musical written for television, but later played on stage, with music by Richard Rodgers and a book and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II.  It is based upon the fairy tale Cinderella, particularly the French version Cendrillon, ou la petite pantoufle de verre ("Cinderella, or The Little Glass Slipper"), by Charles Perrault. The story concerns a young woman forced into a life of servitude by her cruel stepmother and self-centered stepsisters, who dreams of a better life. With the help of her Fairy Godmother, Cinderella is transformed into a Princess and finds her Prince.
Cinderella is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical written for television. It was originally broadcast live on CBS on March 31, 1957 as a vehicle for Julie Andrews, who played the title role. The broadcast was viewed by more than 100 million people. It was subsequently remade for television twice, in 1965 and 1997. The 1965 version starred Lesley Ann Warren and Stuart Damon. The 1997 version starred Brandy Norwood in the title role, with Whitney Houston as the fairy godmother. Both remakes add songs from other Richard Rodgers musicals.
The musical has been adapted for the stage in a number of versions, including a London West End pantomime adaptation, a New York City Opera production that follows the original television version closely, and various touring productions. A 2013 adaptation on Broadway starred Laura Osnes and Santino Fontana, with a new book by Douglas Carter Beane.

<doc id="23094711" title="Come Summer">
Come Summer is a Broadway musical with a book and lyrics by Will Holt and music by David Baker, based on Rainbow on the Road by Esther Forbes and vocal arrangements by Trude Rittmann . The original Broadway production opened on March 18, 1969 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre starring, Ray Bolger, Leonard John Crofoot, David Cryer, Cathryn Damon, Margaret Hamilton, and Barbara Sharma. Directed by Agnes de Mille it closed after 7 performances on March 22, 1969. Despite its short run, David Cryer won the 1969 Theatre World Award.
The story tells of an itinerant peddlar in 19th century New England, and the people whose lives he affects.
Behind the scenes, the musical was a disaster.  Ray Bolger demanded that the producers expand his role; several rewrites later, de Mille herself was fired and replaced by Burt Shevelove.  Only a few days after that, Shevelove exited, and "the producers asked Agnes to come back, but only to choreograph."  De Mille's assistant director, James Mitchell, turned down the director's chair, but became the de facto director anyway.  As a result, "neither she [de Mille] nor anyone else could say who directed the show."  Come Summer turned out to be de Mille's final Broadway production.

The Commitments is a musical written by Roddy Doyle, based on the 1987 novel of the same name, also written by Doyle. Like the novel (and its 1991 film adaptation), the musical is about a group of unemployed Irish youths who start a soul music band. It premiered in 2013 at the Palace Theatre in London's West End.
The music within the musical consists of soul and rock & roll classics from the 1950s and 60s, including  "Think", "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone" and "Night Train". The music is entirely diegetic, meaning that all the songs are performed by the band rather than being sung by characters to express an emotion. For that reason, Doyle has insisted that The Commitments is not a jukebox musical.

<doc id="6802428" title="Das Dreimäderlhaus">
Das Dreimäderlhaus (House of the Three Girls), adapted into English-language versions as Blossom Time and Lilac Time, is a Viennese pastiche operetta with music by Franz Schubert, rearranged by Heinrich Berté (1857–1924), and a libretto by Alfred Maria Willner and Heinz Reichert.  The work gives a fictionalized account of Schubert's romantic life, and the story was adapted from the 1912 novel Schwammerl by Rudolf Hans Bartsch (1873–1952).  Originally the score was mostly Berté, with just one piece of Schubert's ("Ungeduld" from Die schöne Müllerin), but the producers required Berté to discard his score and create a pasticcio of Schubert music.The original production opened at the Raimundtheater in Vienna on 15 January 1916 and ran for over 650 performances in its original run in Austria and for hundreds more in Germany, followed by many successful revivals.  It starred Fritz Schrödter as Schubert and Anny Rainer as Hannerl.  Schrödter was already 60 in 1916. In 1886, he had sung the part of the "Prince of Song" (i.e. Schubert) in Franz von Suppé's operetta about Schubert.  The operetta spawned a sequel entitled Hannerl.  Debuting during World War I, the operetta's popularity was fueled by the public's taste for nostalgia, harnessing an old-fashioned, sentimental story and Schubert's familiar music.  Schubert worked hard to become a successful opera composer but found little success in this genre of music.  With Das Dreimäderlhaus, ironically, his music finally became famous in a stage work.Das Dreimäderlhaus then premiered in Paris on May 7, 1921 in a French adaptation by Hugues Delorme and Léon Abric called Chanson d'amour (Song of Love).  The operetta was a success in France, and soon an English language adaption opened on Broadway as Blossom Time, with a new arrangement of Schubert's music by Sigmund Romberg and an adapted libretto by Dorothy Donnelly.  This debuted at the Ambassador Theatre on September 29, 1921, where it ran for 592 performances; it was revived several times on Broadway over the next two decades.  In London, the operetta was called Lilac Time, with an adapted libretto by Adrian Ross and music arranged by George H. Clutsam, using some of Berté's work.  Lilac Time opened at the Lyric Theatre on December 22, 1922 and ran for 626 performances.  Both the Broadway and West End versions toured extensively in subsequent decades and were frequently revived until the 1950s.
The operetta received productions in over 60 countries and was translated into numerous languages.  By 1961, the piece was estimated to have played over 85,000 performances worldwide.  It still receives occasional productions.

Eileen is a comic opera (sometimes described as a musical) with music by Victor Herbert and lyrics and book by Henry Blossom, based loosely on the 1835 novel Rory O'Moore by Herbert's grandfather, Samuel Lover. Set in 1798, the story concerns an Irish revolutionary arrested by the British for treason.  Eileen, his nobly born sweetheart, helps him to escape by disguising him as a servant.
After two Cleveland performances at the Colonial Theatre on January 1–2, 1917 titled Hearts of Erin, the musical moved on to Boston, changing its name to Eileen. It then opened at the Shubert Theatre on March 19, 1917 and ran for only 64 performances. It was produced by Joe Weber, formerly of the comedy duo Weber and Fields. It then toured, but a fire destroyed its sets and costumes three months into the tour. The show was not revived in New York until the end of the 20th century.  In 1982, a single on-book concert performance was given at Manhattan's Town Hall, featuring E. G. Marshall as O'Day, Judy Kaye as Lady Maude and Roderick Cook as Sir Reginald. In 1997, it was produced and recorded by the Ohio Light Opera. In 2012, a small-scale production was given by the Light Opera of New York.Herbert was eager to write an "Irish" musical to celebrate the land of his birth.  His score was well received by the critics, but the libretto received some harsh reviews.  Alexander Woollcott wrote: "Mr Blossom [must have] gathered his material and atmosphere by reading for quite half an hour in some public library."

<doc id="455616" title="Flower Drum Song">
Flower Drum Song was the eighth musical by the team of Rodgers and Hammerstein. It is based on the 1957 novel, The Flower Drum Song, by Chinese-American author C. Y. Lee. It premiered on Broadway in 1958 and was then performed in the West End and on tour. It was adapted for a 1961 musical film.
After their extraordinary early successes, beginning with Oklahoma! in 1943, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II had written two musicals in the 1950s that did not do well and sought a new hit to revive their fortunes. Lee's novel focuses on a father, Wang Chi-yang, a wealthy refugee from China, who clings to traditional values in San Francisco's Chinatown. Rodgers and Hammerstein shifted the focus of the musical to his son, Wang Ta, who is torn between his Chinese roots and assimilation into American culture. The team hired Gene Kelly to make his debut as a stage director with the musical and scoured the country for a suitable Asian – or at least, plausibly Asian-looking – cast. The musical, much lighter-hearted than Lee's novel, was profitable on Broadway and was followed by a national tour.
After the release of the 1961 film version, the musical was rarely produced, as it presented casting issues and fears that Asian-Americans would take offense at how they are portrayed. When it was put on the stage, lines and songs that might be offensive were often cut. The piece did not return to Broadway until 2002, when a version with a plot by playwright David Henry Hwang (but retaining most of the original songs) was presented after a successful Los Angeles run. Hwang's story retains the Chinatown setting and the inter-generational and immigrant themes, and emphasizes the romantic relationships. It received mostly poor reviews in New York and closed after six months but had a short tour and has since been produced regionally.

<doc id="8089327" title="Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim">
Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim (sometimes called Frankenstein, or The Model Man) is a musical burlesque written by Richard Henry (a pseudonym of Richard Butler and Henry Chance Newton).  The music was composed by Meyer Lutz.  The piece is a burlesque of the 1818 Mary Shelley novel Frankenstein and the Adelphi Theatre drama based on the novel.  
Opening at the Gaiety Theatre, London on 24 December 1887, the production was a flop, closing after a week.  It starred Nellie Farren as Dr. Frankenstein and Fred Leslie as a monster who is in touch with his feminine side.  The Victorian audiences found the piece too feminist in tone.  In addition, the public was annoyed at George Edwardes, who had reduced the size of the inexpensive "pit" in favour of more "stalls".  The piece also featured Marion Hood as the doctor's love interest Tartina; E. J. Lonnen as the vampire Visconti; Emily Cross as Mary Ann; Sylvia Grey as Tamburina, goddess of the sun; Sybil Grey as Vanilla; the dancer John D'Auban as Demonico; and Frank Thornton as Schwank.

Once it was, composer Stuart Brayson thought it might be adapted as a musical, and proposed the project to Tim Rice, who acquired the stage rights and wrote the lyrics.
The musical was announced in May 2011 and opened on 23 October 2013, a year later than originally planned.  The West End production stars Darius Campbell as Warden, Robert Lonsdale as Private Prewitt, and Ryan Sampson as Maggio.
